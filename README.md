# 📊 Unemployment Rate Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores machine learning techniques to forecast unemployment rates in Malaysia. The study aims to assist policymakers in predicting employment fluctuations, reducing job losses, and guiding economic growth through data-driven decision-making.  

By analyzing historical trends, we apply **ARIMA** and **Facebook Prophet** models to predict future unemployment levels, identifying key patterns and trends in the job market.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
✅ Time-series forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet  
✅ Performance evaluation and model comparison  
✅ Insights into unemployment trends over time  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains the number of unemployed persons (in thousands) and their duration of unemployment in Malaysia, spanning from **January 2016 to December 2024**. It was collected monthly from:  
📌 [Official Data Source](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue/lfs_month_duration)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **statsmodels, pmdarima** (ARIMA Model)  
- **Facebook Prophet** (Forecasting)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Model Evaluation)  

## 📥 Installation  
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pmdarima prophet scikit-learn
```

## 📝 Usage  
1️⃣ Load the dataset:  
```python
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_csv('lfs_month_duration.csv')
```
2️⃣ Preprocess and clean the data  
3️⃣ Train ARIMA and Prophet models  
4️⃣ Forecast future unemployment rates  

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- **ARIMA Model (0,1,1)** achieved **98.65% accuracy**, making it highly effective for short-term forecasting.  
- **Facebook Prophet** performed well, capturing long-term trends with an accuracy of **93.55%**.  
- Unemployment rates peaked around 2020 (COVID-19 impact) and showed a gradual decline afterward.
